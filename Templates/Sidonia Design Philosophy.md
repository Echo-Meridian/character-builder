# Sidonia Design Philosophy

## Core Themes
- Noir: Everyone serves someone, information is currency
- Corruption: Every power has a price
- Violence is failure, not solution
- Trade-offs: No perfect builds, only meaningful choices

## Not D&D
- Only 3 attributes
- No classes, only backgrounds and lineages
- No levels, advancement through experience, and training
- Combat is deadly and discouraged
- Social/investigation focus over dungeon crawling

## Character Creation Goals
- Players learn the world through building characters
- Each choice should feel meaningful.
- Priority system forces trade-offs
- Corruption visible but not fully explained
- GM mode hides true underpinnings and hidden machinations of the world 

## Interface Philosophy
- Different UI per lineage (not just re-skins)
- Information reveals progressively
- Mechanical truth shown, narrative truth hidden
- Export must work for both player and GM
