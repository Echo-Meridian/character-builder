          Step through Sidonia&apos;s dark wards with a guide that teaches while it tempts. Assign priorities,
          face the consequences, and build a persona that balances humanity, power, and the whispers of corruption.

          Begin with the priority grid, explore lineage aesthetics, and unlock deeper mechanical truths only when you
          are ready to commit. Every page layers narrative first and detail second, ensuring newcomers learn through
          meaningful choice.

          Continue to the Character Builder to start a new dossier or revisit existing souls you are shepherding
          through the night.
