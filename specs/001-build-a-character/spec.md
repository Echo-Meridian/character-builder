# Feature Specification: Sidonia TTRPG Character Builder

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-character`
**Created**: 2025-09-18
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a character creation and management application for the Sidonia tabletop role-playing game that teaches players the game's themes through the act of building a character. The application presents character creation as a series of meaningful trade-offs using a priority system where players must assign rankings (A through E) to five core aspects: Lineage (what you are), Resources (what you own), Background (who you were), Skills (what you know), and Attributes (your natural capabilities). Each priority assignment cascades into different options and limitations throughout character creation.
The interface should assume zero knowledge of the game system, progressively revealing complexity as players make choices. Information appears in layers - simple descriptions first, mechanical implications upon interaction, and full details only after commitment. Visual presentation changes based on the chosen lineage type, with each of the five lineages having distinct aesthetic themes that reflect their nature. The application tracks corruption as a core mechanic.
Character data includes both mechanical elements (priorities, attributes, skills, powers) and narrative elements (name, description, background details, relationships, notes) with space for role-playing details at every step. Players can navigate backward through choices during creation, exploring different builds before committing. The application supports both character creation and ongoing character management including advancement, corruption tracking, health management by body location, and notation.
A separate game master mode reveals hidden information about powers and game mechanics that players shouldn't see, accessed through a specific authentication method. This GM view shows the true nature and costs of abilities while the player view shows only the surface narrative. All character options and powers load dynamically from structured data files that can be updated without rebuilding the application, essential for beta testing and iterative development.
The application exports characters in a format compatible with virtual tabletop platforms and generates printable character sheets. Progress saves automatically with the ability to maintain multiple character builds simultaneously. The entire experience should feel like descending into a noire narrative where every gain requires sacrifice and power always comes with a price.
The character builder should collect anonymous usage analytics without user identifiers to track character creation paths, choice patterns, and completion rates for game design improvement but not collect any personally identifiable information. players should be informed that anonymous usage data is collected for game improvement.
The core system is fully developed and a number of Jsons, Schema and MD files will be available for you to reference in building the application."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a player new to the Sidonia TTRPG system, I want to create a character through an intuitive interface that teaches me the game mechanics gradually while making meaningful choices about my character's identity, abilities, and background. The process should feel like crafting a noir narrative where every choice has consequences and power comes with corruption.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new player with no Sidonia knowledge, **When** they start character creation, **Then** they see simple descriptions of the priority system and can explore options without commitment
2. **Given** a player has assigned priorities A-E to all five aspects, **When** they proceed to the next step, **Then** they see cascading options and limitations based on their priority choices
3. **Given** a player has made character choices, **When** they navigate backward, **Then** they can modify previous selections and see how changes cascade through later choices
4. **Given** a completed character, **When** the player exports, **Then** they receive both a VTT-compatible file and a printable character sheet
5. **Given** a Game Master accessing the application, **When** they authenticate to GM mode, **Then** they can see hidden mechanical information about powers and abilities
6. **Given** a player using the application, **When** they make choices during creation, **Then** anonymous usage data is collected with their informed consent

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a player tries to assign the same priority rank to multiple aspects?
- How does the system handle partial character saves if the session is interrupted?
- What occurs when game data files are updated while a character is being created?
- How does the application handle conflicting character choices (e.g., incompatible lineage and background combinations)?
- What happens if a player tries to access GM mode without proper authentication?
