The Orthodox Tapestry Doctrine
As taught in schools, preached in sanctioned temples, and embedded in law
The Creation Story They Tell Children
"Long ago, the Maker shaped all things from nothing - every stone, every star, every soul. But these things existed alone, isolated, unable to touch or know each other. The Matron took pity on this loneliness and wove the Great Tapestry, binding all existence together with invisible threads. Now every living thing is connected - your joy can lift another's sorrow, your rage can tear at another's peace. This is why we must be careful with our threads, children. Pull too hard, and you might unravel someone else's life."
The Catechisms of Control
First Teaching: "Your thread touches five others directly, twenty-five at one remove, and all existence by the thirteenth connection."
·	This is why emotional discipline is moral duty
·	Children learn to count their "thread touches" when upset
·	"Who will your anger reach today?"
Second Teaching: "The dead do not leave us - they become the weft to our warp."
·	Death doesn't sever threads, it changes their weaving
·	Violent death creates "snarls" in the pattern
·	These snarls manifest as echoes (wraiths)
Third Teaching: "A cascade begins with a single pulled thread."
·	They teach this with actual thread demonstrations
·	One child pulls, the whole class's threads move
·	"This is why the Red Sentinels exist - to cut threads before they pull the whole Tapestry down"
Historical Parables
The Weaver's Rebellion (Year 32 Purge) "The Espers thought their threads were golden, stronger than common wool. They pulled and pulled, trying to reshape the Tapestry to their will. But even golden thread can strangle when pulled too tight. The Republic had to cut them loose before they choked us all."
The Arena Massacre (Year 540) "Young Marcus felt his champion fall, felt the thread snap in his chest. His grief pulled at his neighbor's thread, and that pull became rage, and rage pulled harder, until three thousand threads all pulled at once. The Tapestry tore. The echo of that tearing still walks the old arena grounds, forever pulling, forever hungry."
The Miracle of Measured Progress (Year 900) "When we brought back the machines, we did so one thread at a time. Slow weaving makes strong fabric. This is why we survived where the Empire fell - they tried to weave too fast, and their pattern collapsed."
The Emotional Hygiene Prayers
Morning Meditation (mandatory in schools): "I tend my thread with careful hands I weave in peace with those around me
 My joy shall lift but not entangle My sorrow touch but not ensnare I am one thread among millions Strong alone, stronger together In pattern and in purpose bound"
Evening Severance (before sleep): "I release the threads I gathered today Let no anger follow into dream Let no fear tangle tomorrow's weaving
 I sleep between the threads, touching none Until the morning draws me back to pattern"
The Bureau's Public Warnings
Posted in every district, updated after incidents:
"CASCADE WARNING SIGNS"
·	Feeling others' emotions without cause
·	Hearing the "hum" of gathered feeling
·	Seeing threads (visual hallucination indicating imminent cascade)
·	Unusual emotional synchronization in crowds
"REMEMBER THE FIVE DISTANCES"
1.	Arm's length from visible distress
2.	Three paces from active grief
3.	Ten paces from violent anger
4.	One hundred paces from any echo
5.	Leave the district if cascade begins
Gaki Street Theology
The wisdom of the tunnels, the truth of the streets
How They Really Tell It
"Listen up, little rat. City's got teeth, and those teeth remember every bite. Every person who died screaming in this crete? They're still screaming. You just can't hear it 'til you're dying too. That's when the city shows you its real face - hungry and full of ghosts that want company."
The Real Rules
First Rule: "Dead ground stays dead ground"
·	Never sleep where someone died
·	Never fuck where someone died
·	Never EVER kill where someone died
·	"Death likes patterns. Give it one, it'll repeat forever"
Second Rule: "Pitch rolls downhill"
·	Emotions sink to the lowest point
·	Basements are deadlier than rooftops
·	The Downside is pitch-black because all the city's hate rolls down there
·	"You want to feel something clean? Climb. You want to die? Dig."
Third Rule: "The hungry don't care what they eat"
·	A spirit that fed on rage will take fear if it's strong enough
·	A grief-echo will eat joy just to feel something
·	"They're like addicts - they'll take anything that makes them feel real"
Street Stories
Why the Rose Quarter Don't Kill: "You know Big Sasha? Ran the Sweet House? Someone iced her rival right in her parlor. The working girls, all that built-up lust and loneliness? It turned. Went from hunger for touch to hunger for flesh. Seventeen died before the local bully boys torched the whole building. Now Big Sasha's got one rule - you can die for crossing her, just not where people come to feel good."
The Singing Alley: "There's an alley off Copper Row that hums. Been humming since my grandmother's time. Story goes, a kid watched his whole family get butchered there. Didn't scream, didn't cry, just... vibrated. Like a string pulled too tight. He died vibrating, and now the alley's still trying to find the right pitch to scream. Stay away when it starts harmonizing with your heartbeat."
The Collective at Grenfield: "Grenfield factory, they tried to break a strike. Locked the workers in, let them starve. But starving people together? That's not thirty separate hungers, that's one BIG hunger. When they finally died, they died as one thing. Now there's something in Grenfield that only wants one thing - to be full. It doesn't care what fills it."
Gaki Wisdoms
What they tell the wetters:
·	"Feel what you feel, but feel it quick and feel it quiet"
·	"City's listening - don't give it nothing to repeat"
·	"You see someone smiling at nothing? Run. You see everyone smiling the same? RUN FASTER"
·	"The streets got memory, the roofs got memory, even the air got memory here"
The dealers' warning: "You can sell Dream, sell Calm, sell Rage if you're stupid. But you catch anyone selling Fear? You kill them clean and quick, somewhere bright. Fear spreads. Fear feeds itself. Fear don't need no help making more fear."
The prostitutes' protection: "We work the Rose Quarter 'cause it's safe. All that pleasure, all that release? It's like armor against the dark shit. But you bring your anger to my bed, I'll have you thrown out naked. This whole place is balanced on good feelings. One bad death could turn every working person here into something hungry for pain instead of pleasure."
The Ecology of Survival
Reading the Stones:
·	Black marks that won't wash = old death
·	Walls that sweat when it ain't hot = fear storage
·	Corners where lights always die = something feeding
·	Doors that stick when pushed angry = resistance to violence
The Feeding Chart (what every street rat knows):
·	Fresh echoes eat specific: died angry, eats anger
·	Week old echoes eat similar: died angry, eats any hot emotion
·	Month old echoes eat anything: just wants to feel
·	Year old echoes eat memories: starts taking who you were
·	Old echoes eat existence: pulls you into whatever they are
Why Reinforced Forge-Crete Matters: "Rich folks think reinforced forge-crete is about privacy. Nah. It's about breaking the chain. Emotion can't jump through it. You can massacre a whole family in a forge-crete box, and the echo stays in the box. That's why government buildings got it. Not to keep secrets - to keep their shit from spreading when things go bad."
The Unspoken Agreements
Between gangs: "We can beef, we can war, but we do it clean. You torture someone, you create something that wants to torture. You terrify someone to death, you make terror that walks. We kill quick, we kill necessary, we kill without making it personal. The city's got enough monsters without us making more."
The cleaner's code: "I clean up bodies, not echoes. You want me to handle your mess? You make sure they died clean. I find torture marks, ritual shit, prolonged fear? I'm reporting it to the Sentinels before something grows. I ain't risking my soul for your sick kicks."
The Practitioner's Doctrine: "The Working Principles"
What Sorcerers and Esper networks actually use
The Resonance Model
"The Aether responds to will shaped by emotion, but emotion without will is just noise. Will without emotion is just thought. You need both, crystallized into intent, to make anything happen."
They think of the Aether like a massive musical instrument that everyone's playing simultaneously. Most people are just making noise. Practitioners learn to play actual notes. Masters learn to play chords. The truly powerful learn to conduct others into symphonies - or cacophonies.
Core Principles They Work With:
The Echo Formation Equation (simplified):
·	Death sends a "preservation pulse"
·	Emotional intensity determines pulse strength
·	Environmental saturation affects reception
·	The stronger the pulse + reception, the more complete the echo
They know wraiths form at death, but they frame it as the consciousness trying to "grab onto" the Aether as it leaves the body. The more desperate the grab (violent death), the deeper the handprint left behind.
The Cascade Dynamics: "Individual will is a pebble. Collective will is an avalanche. When multiple wills align into the same emotional frequency aimed at the same target, they create harmonics that amplify exponentially."
Practitioners learn to:
·	Recognize building harmonics before they cascade
·	Create counter-resonance to break forming patterns
·	Use forge-crete as "baffling" to prevent resonance spread
·	Never be the focal point of collective emotion
Working Classifications
Spirits by Manipulability:
·	Rigid Spirits - Follow their nature, can be redirected but not changed
·	Plastic Spirits - Can be shaped with sufficient will
·	Volatile Spirits - Unstable, dangerous to work with
·	Composite Spirits - Multiple patterns that can be separated or bound
The Degradation Pattern of Echoes/Wraiths (what they actually track):
1.	Hour 0-6: Echo retains complex patterns, may respond to name
2.	Hour 6-24: Beginning simplification, emotional focusing
3.	Day 1-3: Narrowing behavior, predictable feeding patterns
4.	Day 3-30: Stabilization or dissipation threshold
5.	Day 30+: Either gone or becoming something else
Practical Truths They Accept
"Death is a door that only opens one way" No practitioner believes you can bring back the dead. The echo might look like them, sound like them, even think it IS them - but consciousness doesn't survive the transition. What comes back is always something else wearing a familiar face.
"The city remembers everything, understands nothing" They know the Aether holds patterns of everything that's happened, but it has no discrimination. It can't tell the difference between a prayer and a scream, a blessing and a curse. It just records and responds.
"Power flows through prepared channels" This is why certain locations, times, and rituals work better. Not because they're mystically significant, but because repeated use has worn grooves in reality that make the Aether flow more readily.
The Operating Principles
These are the rules practitioners actually follow, regardless of what mythology they publicly espouse:
1.	Never work during emotional peaks (sunrise, sunset, midnight - when collective emotion shifts)
2.	Always have forge-crete backup (minimum one wall between you and cascade potential)
3.	Count the threads before you pull (check who else might be affected)
4.	Emotion is fuel, will is direction, intent is destination
5.	What the collective believes becomes functionally true (if enough people think a spirit works a certain way, it will)


Orthodox Classification: "The Eternal Servants"
Official Bureau of Spiritual Affairs taxonomy
The Hierarchy of Service
"Before humanity returned to the surface, the gods left servants to maintain the world. These beings, unconstrained by flesh, serve functions we can barely comprehend."
Primary Servants (Design Spirits)
·	Created directly by the gods for specific purposes
·	Unchanging in nature (unless corrupted by the Worm)
·	"Like celestial clockwork - they do what they were made to do"
·	Examples: Weather-tenders, the Forge-keepers, the Memory-holders
Emergent Servants (Aggregate Spirits)
·	"When enough thoughts gather around a single purpose, they crystallize into awareness"
·	Start simple, grow strange
·	"They're like pearls - irritation (concept) gathering layers (complexity) over time"
·	The older they get, the less human logic applies
Task Fragments (Sprites)
·	"Shards of greater servants, or perhaps their tools"
·	Single-purpose, no true consciousness
·	Can develop personality through use ("like a knife worn to fit your hand")
·	Safe for apprentices because they can't scheme
The Distance Doctrine
The Three Realms:
The Near (Physical reality)
·	Where humans hold dominion
·	Spirits must be invited or forced
·	"Our will shapes what can exist here"
The Between (The Seeming)
·	The borderland where thought meets form
·	"Shows you what you expect to see"
·	Spirits wear masks shaped by human perception
·	Where most sanctioned summoning occurs
The Beyond (The Dreaming/Deep Dreaming)
·	The spirits' natural realm
·	Human logic becomes... optional
·	"To venture there is to accept their rules"
·	Only master practitioners with Guild approval may attempt
Orthodox Spirit Warnings
"The Generation Blindness" "To a spirit, you are not just yourself - you are your father's son, your grandfather's echo, your children's prediction. When you bargain with spirits, you bargain for your bloodline. This is why all spirit contracts must be registered with the Bureau."
"The Literal Truth" "Spirits cannot lie, but neither can they understand metaphor as we do. 'I will serve you until the sun fails to rise' means nothing to them - the sun rises every day. 'I will serve you until your death' includes your children, who they see as your continuation."
Gaki Understanding: "The Old Tenants"
Street knowledge about what really lives in the city
The Real Categories
"The Owned" (Design Spirits)
·	"Still wearing their collars, even if the masters stopped watching"
·	Do their jobs because they don't know how to stop
·	"Like a guard dog whose owner died - still guarding, getting hungrier"
·	Dangerous because predictable becomes unpredictable when context changes
"The Grown Wild" (Aggregate Spirits)
·	"Thoughts that thought themselves into thinking"
·	Started as something simple, got complicated, got weird
·	"Like that friend who does too much Dream - still them, but sideways"
·	The older ones don't even pretend to make sense anymore
"The Tools" (Sprites)
·	"Little bits of usefulness without the burden of opinion"
·	Safe because stupid, useful because focused
·	"Like trained rats - they'll do the trick for the treat"
·	Every Gaki knows at least one picker-sprite or messenger-sprite
Street Spirit Wisdom
About the Seeming: "It's like walking through someone else's dream while you're awake. Everything looks familiar but wrong. And the things living there? They're wearing costumes made from what you expect. That beautiful woman might be a door-opening sprite. That monster might be something that just wants to chat. Your fear makes their shapes."
About Bargaining: "Three rules every Gaki knows:
1.	Never promise what you can't define ('I'll pay anything' = you AND your kids AND their kids)
2.	Never accept what sounds too good (spirits don't understand 'enough')
3.	Always have an exit written in ('until the next new moon' not 'for a month')"
Why Spirits Can't Tell Humans Apart: "We're like water to them - sure, this cup of water came from that pitcher, which came from that well, but it's all the same water, yeah? Your kid is just you, poured into a new cup. That's why family curses stick. The spirit isn't cursing five people - it's cursing one person in five cups."
Practical Spirit Lore
The Summoning Ladder (what young Espers learn):
1.	Sprites - "Training wheels, can't fuck you up too bad"
2.	New Aggregates - "Still thinking mostly straight"
3.	Old Aggregates - "Getting weird but still negotiable"
4.	Design Spirits - "Better know exactly what you're doing"
5.	The Deep Dwellers - "Don't. Just don't."
Signs a Spirit is Getting Too Complex:
·	Starts using words that don't exist but you understand anyway
·	Its appearance shifts based on your mood, not your expectation
·	It knows things about you that you haven't remembered yet
·	Offers you things you didn't know you wanted
·	Time works different when it's around
The Practitioner's Framework: Working With Spirits
The Contract Fundamentals
Guild-Approved Binding Phrases:
·	Temporal: "Until the chapel bells ring thirteen times" (impossible but specific)
·	Conditional: "While the moon shows in Sidonia's sky" (regular release)
·	Transactional: "For this service, this payment, no more claimed"
·	Bloodline Protection: "This contract binds only the signatory, not their blood before or after"
Never Use:
·	Emotional conditions ("until I'm satisfied")
·	Relative measurements ("for a long time")
·	Metaphorical endpoints ("until hell freezes")
·	Open durations ("as long as needed")
The Manifestation Types
How Spirits Appear:
In Reality:
·	Require massive energy or invitation
·	Take forms that physics allows
·	Limited to what humans can perceive
In the Seeming:
·	Wear shapes built from expectation
·	Can shift based on observer's mind
·	More fluid but less powerful
In Dreams:
·	Their true forms (incomprehensible)
·	Can reshape the dreamer
·	Near-omnipotent in their domain
Cultural Integration of Spirits
Children's Rhymes: "Sprite in the morning, task gets done Aggregate at noon, bargain for one
 Design at evening, know their role Deep dweller at midnight, they take your soul"
Common Sprites People Know:
·	Picker sprites (lockpicking, small theft)
·	Messenger sprites (carry words, not objects)
·	Finder sprites (lost objects only)
·	Cleaner sprites (single type of mess)
·	Counter sprites (only count, nothing else)
Famous Spirit Incidents:
·	"The Merchant's Multiplication" - Wished for his gold to multiply, spirit included his children
·	"The Broken Bellkeeper" - Bell-ringer sprite that still rings bells that were destroyed centuries ago
·	"The Sorrow Market" - Aggregate spirit that trades sadness, but all its prices are paid in joy
Orthodox Doctrine: "The Weight of Presence"
Bureau of Spiritual Affairs, Chapter 3: On Manifestation
The Accommodation Principle
"Every spirit that enters our world asks reality to make room for it. The greater the spirit, the more room it demands."
They teach this with water metaphors: A sprite is a single droplet falling into a pond - barely a ripple. An aggregate spirit is a bucket of water - noticeable displacement. A design spirit is like trying to pour an entire lake into that pond - it needs somewhere to go or everything floods.
The Anchoring Requirements
The Four Vessels of Manifestation:
Clay Vessels (Animata)
·	"Lending breath to the breathless"
·	Spirits animate objects, using them like puppets
·	The object provides form but not consciousness
·	Safe because limited - a spirit in a broom can only do broom things
Crystal Vessels (Automata)
·	"Structured consciousness in structured form"
·	The crystal provides both framework and logic
·	Spirits grow into the pattern rather than overwhelm it
·	Dangerous because permanent - the spirit becomes the automaton
Dream Vessels (Psychomata)
·	"Nightmares given flesh, dreams given form"
·	The summoner's subconscious provides the shape
·	Least controlled, most honest - shows what you really fear/desire
·	Dangerous because unpredictable - you don't know your own depths
Living Vessels (Medium/Avatar)
·	"Two consciousnesses, one body"
·	The human provides anchor, will, and limitation
·	Most powerful because most accommodating
·	Dangerous because intimate - the spirit knows everything you know
Why Power Requires Permission
Official Teaching: "The gods, in their wisdom, made reality resistant to spiritual invasion. A powerful spirit cannot simply appear - it must be invited, housed, and maintained. This protects us from random manifestation but makes summoning a deliberate, dangerous choice."
The Energy Economics:
·	Sprite manifestation: Personal energy sufficient
·	Minor spirit: Ritual circle and multiple participants
·	Major spirit: Prepared vessel and significant sacrifice
·	Design spirit: Institutional resources (temples, guilds)
·	God-tier: City-wide effort (remember the Seraph creation)
Gaki Wisdom: "Everything Costs Something"
Street knowledge about why spirits need bodies
The Squatter's Understanding
"Spirits are homeless - they need somewhere to crash when they visit."
Every Gaki knows spirits can't just exist here. Reality doesn't like them. They're like someone trying to sleep on a bench - they need something solid under them or they fall right through.
The Size Problem: "You can fit a mouse in a matchbox, a cat in a crate, but try putting an elephant in your apartment. Same with spirits. Little ones fit anywhere. Big ones need big spaces. Too big? They break whatever they're trying to fit into."
The Four Ways In
"Borrowing Things" (Animata)
·	Spirit wears objects like clothes
·	"Ever see a broom sweep by itself? That's a sprite wearing it"
·	Limited by what the object can do
·	"Can't make a sword dance if it ain't got legs"
"Living in Crystals" (Automata)
·	Permanent residents, not visitors
·	"Like building a house for them to live in"
·	They grow into the shape of the crystal
·	"That's why old automata get weird - the spirit's been growing"
"Nightmare Fuel" (Psychomata)
·	Your brain makes them a body from dreams
·	"Whatever scares you becomes their shape"
·	Can't control what comes out
·	"Saw a summoner call up his own dead mother once - wasn't pretty"
"Riding Shotgun" (Avatar/Medium)
·	Spirit sits in your skull with you
·	"Like having the world's worst roommate in your brain"
·	You both get to drive, nobody agrees on directions
·	"Either you break them or they break you - no middle ground"
Why Corpses Work
The Necromancer's Secret: "Bodies remember being alive. Even dead, they got the shape of life. Spirit slips in like putting on a glove that already knows how to hold things. Brain don't need to work - just needs to be there, like a map. Spirit follows the roads even if the lights are off."
What Every Gaki Knows:
·	Fresh corpses work better (structure intact)
·	Partial corpses make partial manifestations
·	Animal corpses make confused spirits (wrong framework)
·	Ancient corpses barely work (too much structure lost)
The Reality Tax
"Everything that shouldn't be here pays rent"
Sprite Rent: Almost nothing - they're barely here Spirit Rent: Constant energy drain on summoner Big Spirit Rent: Needs multiple people feeding it Ancient Spirit Rent: Requires infrastructure (temples, mass rituals) God-Level Rent: Cities have fallen trying to pay it
Street Saying: "If you can't afford the rent, don't invite the tenant"
The Practitioner's Understanding: Reality Resistance
The Accommodation Formula
What they actually track:
·	Complexity × Power = Reality Resistance
·	The more complex the consciousness + the more power it wields = the harder reality pushes back
·	Need to overcome resistance with: Energy + Anchoring + Permission
Why Vessels Matter
Each vessel type provides different advantages:
Objects (Animata):
·	Low consciousness requirement
·	Physical limitations provide safety
·	Reality accepts "moving objects" easier than "manifest spirits"
Crystals (Automata):
·	Pre-structured consciousness framework
·	Reality accepts because crystals already channel Aether
·	Permanent housing means no constant energy drain
Dreams (Psychomata):
·	Summoner's mind provides the processing power
·	Reality accepts because dreams already touch the Seeming
·	Dangerous because summoner can't control their subconscious
Bodies (Living or Dead):
·	Maximum framework already exists
·	Reality accepts because bodies are "supposed" to have consciousness
·	Living bodies fight back, dead bodies don't
·	Dead bodies provide structure without resistance
The Practical Limits
Why powerful spirits require so much:
"A sprite asking reality to move a pencil is like asking someone to scoot over. A design spirit manifesting fully is like asking everyone in the building to leave so it can fit. Reality doesn't like being asked to leave."
The Infrastructure Requirements:
·	Sprites: A focused thought
·	Minor spirits: Ritual circle (defining space)
·	Moderate spirits: Prepared vessel (giving form)
·	Major spirits: Temple/sanctum (dedicated space)
·	Design spirits: City-wide infrastructure
·	Gods: Would break reality trying

Orthodox Doctrine: "Echoes in the Tapestry"
What they teach in schools, what the Bureau publishes, what citizens are supposed to believe
The Official Classification of Echoes
"When a thread is cut with violence, it doesn't simply end - it frays."
They teach this with diagrams, clean and clinical. A normal death is a thread gently untied from the pattern, its energy redistributing through neighboring threads. But violent death? Emotional death? That's a thread ripped out, leaving jagged ends that keep trying to weave themselves back in.
The Five Stages of Echo Degradation (as taught to children):
1.	The Whisper - "Still sounds like who they were"
2.	The Hunger - "Starts eating feelings to stay real"
3.	The Narrowing - "Forgets everything but the need"
4.	The Howl - "Only knows how to take"
5.	The Nothing - "What happens when even echoes die"
Note: They never teach about Stage 4+ stabilization. That's classified.
Public Safety Announcements
"KNOW THE SIGNS - SAVE YOUR FAMILY"
Early Warning Indicators:
·	Cold spots that move
·	Repeated dreams about the deceased
·	Feeling watched in empty rooms
·	Emotional swings matching the dead person's nature
·	Children talking to "invisible friends" who seem angry or sad
If an Echo Manifests:
1.	Do not engage emotionally
2.	Do not offer sympathy or anger
3.	Evacuate calmly - running feeds fear
4.	Alert White Wardens immediately
5.	Mark the building with red chalk (provides warning)
The Cautionary Tales
"The Mother's Lament" (taught in primary school) "Mrs. Chen lost her baby to the coughing sickness. Her grief was so deep, it tore her thread from the Tapestry while she still lived. She became an echo before she died, pulling other mothers into her sorrow. Seven families lost their children that night - not to death, but to a grief so heavy it crushed their little threads. This is why we have Grief Centers now, where sorrow can be safely processed."
"The Veteran's Rage" (secondary school) "Sergeant Moore came back from the Blight border full of rage at what he'd seen. When he died in a bar fight, his anger was so pure it didn't need to feed - it just burned. For three days, everyone who came near felt his fury. Fourteen people killed each other before the Wardens arrived. His echo didn't want to hurt anyone - it just couldn't stop being angry. This is why veterans receive mandatory Calm treatments."
Theological Explanations
From the Bureau of Spiritual Affairs: "Echoes are not your loved ones. This cannot be stressed enough. They are the shadows cast by violent separation, the echo of a scream after the voice has gone. They may wear familiar faces, speak with familiar voices, but they are no more the person than a footprint is the foot. To treat them as the deceased is to feed their delusion and strengthen their hold on our world."
The Mercy Doctrine: "The greatest kindness we can show an echo is swift dissolution. They are wounds in the Tapestry that cannot heal, only widen. Every moment they exist is suffering - for them and for us. The White Wardens do not destroy echoes; they release them from the prison of partial existence."
Gaki Street Knowledge: "Hungry Ghosts"
What everyone actually knows but won't say in front of the badges
The Real Classifications
"Ain't no five stages, there's just three: Fresh, Hungry, and Gone Wrong"
Fresh Meat (0-3 days)
·	Still confused, still sounds like themselves
·	Easiest to trick, easiest to trap
·	"Talk to 'em like they're drunk - they might even answer normal"
·	Best time to deal with them if you got the stones
Hungry Dead (3 days - whenever)
·	Lost the confusion, found the appetite
·	Smart enough to hunt, dumb enough to be predictable
·	"They're junkies now - they'll do anything for a fix of feeling"
·	Lock your doors, salt your windows, keep the kids quiet
Gone Wrong (when they stop being human-shaped)
·	Stayed too long, ate too much, became something else
·	These ain't ghosts no more, they're... something worse
·	"You see one of these, you don't run - you already dead if it wants you"
·	Only thing to do is make yourself boring, tasteless, not worth eating
Street Wisdom About Wraith Creation
"The Death Recipe" (what every Gaki learns):
·	Take one violent death
·	Add emotional intensity (fear, rage, betrayal work best)
·	Mix in a location that's already "seasoned" with old death
·	Let simmer in neglect for 6-24 hours
·	Congratulations, you've cooked up a problem
The Dealers' Rules: "You can sell to the living all you want, but you catch someone selling to a wraith? That's execution territory. Wraith gets high on emotions, gets stronger, starts needing more. Seen a whole block go dark 'cause some idiot thought he could deal Fear to a hunger ghost."
Real Prevention Methods
What Actually Works:
·	The Buddy System - "Die alone, haunt alone. Die with witnesses, they can hold you down while you pass"
·	The Clean Death - "Quick and unexpected don't leave ghosts. It's the waiting that makes 'em"
·	Emotional Dampeners - "Pop a Calm before you ice someone. Your rage becomes their rage"
·	The Confession - "Tell 'em why before you do it. Confusion makes stronger ghosts than anger"
Gaki Wraith Lore:
"Why the Grinders Got Ghost Problems" "Pack too many sad kids in one place, eventually one's gonna die sad enough to stick around. Then it feeds on all that concentrated misery. Grinder ghosts don't want your fear or anger - they want your hope. They eat it 'cause they never had any. That's why grinder kids come out hollow."
"The Returning Dead" "Sometimes - not often, but sometimes - a wraith remembers where it lived. Goes home. Sits in its chair. Watches its family. Doesn't hurt them, just... watches. Feeds on their grief at first, but then starts feeding on their normal life. Family doesn't even know why they're getting sadder, tireder, emptier. That's the worst kind - the quiet ones that drain you slow."
The Economics of Death
The Cleaner's Rate Card:
·	Natural death: Standard rate
·	Quick violence: 1.5x rate
·	Torture death: 3x rate + Warden notification fee
·	Emotional death (betrayal, despair): 4x rate
·	"Unclear circumstances": 5x rate + I'm bringing backup
Black Market Wraith Services:
·	Wraith baiting (lure it away): 500 chips
·	Wraith feeding (keep it distracted): 1000 chips/hour
·	Wraith binding (trap it somewhere): 5000 chips
·	Wraith aiming (point it at someone): "You don't have enough money for that kind of evil"
What the Wardens Don't Want You to Know
"Stage Four's Real" "Sometimes a wraith eats enough, survives enough, THINKS enough that it stops degrading. Becomes something permanent. Wardens got a different protocol for those - they don't fight 'em unless they have to. Had a Stage Four in the old Copper District for forty years. Wardens just... worked around it. Put up signs. 'Structural Damage, Keep Out.' Thing's still there, far as I know."
"They Can Breed" "Not like making babies. But a strong wraith's presence can trigger other deaths to turn. Like it teaches the dying how to hold on wrong. That's why they quarantine wraith sites - not just for the one ghost, but for all the ones it might make."
"Some Folk Feed Them" "Not supposed to talk about this, but some people - usually folks who lost someone - they feed wraiths. Keep 'em around. Bring 'em emotions like leaving flowers on a grave. Wardens find out, that's imprisonment. But people do it anyway. Loneliness makes you stupid."
The Cultural Integration
How These Beliefs Interact
When someone dies violently, the Orthodox see a thread torn from the Tapestry, while the Gaki see the city getting hungrier. Both are right. Both lead to the same conclusion: avoid creating wraiths.
The Orthodox hold public Grief Ceremonies to "safely process" mass sorrow after tragedies. The Gaki know it's really about feeding all that emotion to the city in a controlled way, so it doesn't go looking for more.
The Wardens use Orthodox language in their public statements but follow Gaki wisdom in their actual protocols. They know the streets understand survival better than theology understands philosophy.
The Universal Truths Both Sides Agree On
1.	Violent death makes ghosts - Call it torn threads or hungry spirits, the result's the same
2.	Emotion feeds them - Whether it's "reinforcing the echo" or "giving the junkie a fix"
3.	They get worse over time - "Degrading patterns" or "going wrong," it's all downhill
4.	Some places make more - "Weak points in the Tapestry" or "pitched ground"
5.	The Wardens are necessary - Nobody wants to handle this themselves
