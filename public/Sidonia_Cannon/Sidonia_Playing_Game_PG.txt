Section 7: Playing Sidonia: What You Need to Know
Intrigue and Corruption: The Real Battlefield
You can play Sidonia however you want. You can kick down doors, throw punches, and solve problems with violence if that's your style. But understand this: the game is built for a different kind of fight.
The most dangerous threats in Sidonia don't meet you in a fair fight. They don't announce themselves. They work from the shadows, through proxies, with leverage you don't even know they have. Your deadliest enemies aren't the thugs in the alley—they're the ones who sent the thugs, the ones whose names you don't know yet, the ones who might be shaking your hand at a council meeting while signing your death warrant in another room.
Some of the most dangerous factions in Sidonia aren't even detailed in this handbook. They're in the Game Master's Guide, hidden deliberately, because that's how they operate in the world. They walk in daylight. They wear respectable titles. They might be people you admire, people you trust, people you're working for.
Every action has weight. You get a stubborn clerk fired for blocking your paperwork? Congratulations—you just removed a piece from someone else's game board, and now you're a player whether you wanted to be or not. You put a street thug in the hospital? He was running errands for a Ward Boss. Now what? Do you owe compensation? Are you in debt? Or have you just made an enemy who'll spend the next six months quietly dismantling your life without ever showing their face?
Everyone in Sidonia—everyone—is part of a web of debts, favors, and threats. Understanding these connections isn't optional. It's survival.
And corruption cuts both ways. That city official who takes your bribe for information? The same corruption that made them take your money means they'll sell that information—and your name—to whoever pays more. Your twenty dollars just became someone else's opening bid. In Sidonia, every piece of information is a weapon, and every weapon gets sold to the highest bidder.
Strategy, subtlety, and understanding the dance of power—that's what this game rewards. Violence is easy. Surviving the consequences is hard.
Grimdark: The Weight You Carry
Sidonia is bleak. It's broken. It's a city-state drowning in its own bureaucracy, where corruption isn't just common—it's structural. The system is so bloated and compromised that even the people who thrive in corrupt systems get lost in it. Try to manipulate one piece of the governmental machine, and you alert three factions you didn't know existed, each with their own agendas.
This is a place where villains feel at home. Where the shadows welcome them. Where every corner offers refuge to people with bad intentions and worse methods.
But here's the thing: Sidonia is not condemned.
The grimdark atmosphere isn't there for shock value or edgy indulgence. It's there because it's true—this is what a thousand years of stagnation looks like. This is what happens when systems designed to protect people calcify into systems designed to protect themselves.
You can be a beacon in this darkness. You can push back. You can make things better.
But you need to understand what you're up against. This didn't happen overnight. Centuries of rot don't get cleaned up in a weekend. The traditions of bureaucracy and corruption are old, and they're defended by people who benefit from them. Change is possible, but it's slow, painful, and often comes at great personal cost.
You don't have to save the world. You don't even have to try.
Sometimes the story is just about holding onto your values when everyone around you has sold theirs. Sometimes it's about delivering justice to one predator in a city full of them. Sometimes it's about protecting one neighborhood, one person, one principle.
The grimdark setting exists to test you. To see if you'll compromise. To see if you'll break. To see if you can stand in the rain and the filth and the corruption and still say "not this, not here, not today."
That's the story worth telling.
Urban Fantasy: Magic Doesn't Fix Broken Things
Magic exists in Sidonia. Openly. Sorcerers, Espers, Spirits, Chimera—these aren't myths or rumors. They're part of the daily landscape. The average citizen might not directly interact with these forces, but they know they exist. They know enough to be careful. They know enough to be afraid.
You, as a character in this world, will be deeply entangled with the supernatural. You might fight creatures from the Aether. You might counter the schemes of people wielding powers far beyond human capability. Magic will be part of your life, part of your problems, part of your solutions.
But magic doesn't change human nature.
People are still people. They're greedy, ambitious, petty, noble, cowardly, and brave—sometimes all in the same afternoon. Institutions are still flawed because they're built and run by flawed people. Corruption exists with or without magic. Injustice exists with or without magic.
What magic does is magnify everything.
It makes the powerful more powerful. It makes the desperate more dangerous. It makes the corrupt more insidious and the virtuous more vulnerable. Magic doesn't whitewash Sidonia's problems or condemn it to eternal darkness—it just turns up the volume on what's already there.
The dark underbelly gets darker. The acts of courage shine brighter. The stakes get higher because the tools to win—or lose—are more potent.
Magic is a mirror held up to Sidonia. It shows you what the city really is, amplified and impossible to ignore.
How to Play: Roleplaying Noir in a World of Magic
Your Character's Motivations
Noir protagonists are flawed. They're complicated. They operate in shades of gray, driven by personal obsessions, past traumas, or dark secrets they're trying to outrun.
When you build your character, dig deep. What drives them isn't "I want to be a hero" or "I want to do good." It's personal. It's specific. It's probably a little bit broken.
·	A vendetta against the syndicate that killed their partner
·	An obsession with uncovering their own lost memories
·	A need to prove they're more than the freak everyone sees when they look at their mutations
·	A desperate attempt to pay off a debt before the collectors come calling
Your character can have noble intentions—plenty of noir protagonists do—but those intentions should be tangled up with personal stakes. The detective isn't cleaning up the city because it's the right thing to do; they're doing it because this city broke them and they refuse to let it win.
Embrace the Ambiance
Sidonia is atmospheric. Rain-slicked streets, flickering neon, smoke curling from cigarettes in dark bars. The distant wail of a saxophone. The smell of ozone and rust and something chemical you can't quite place.
When you roleplay, use this. Describe your environment. Set the scene. Pull your fellow players into the mood with you.
·	"I pull my coat tighter against the rain and duck into the alley."
·	"The bar smells like stale beer and broken dreams. Perfect."
·	"The Aether hums in my teeth. Something's wrong here."
The ambiance isn't just decoration—it's part of the story. Make it matter.
Magic is Mundane (To You)
You live in Sidonia. You've seen magic your entire life. Encountering a Chimera on the street, watching a Sorcerer work a formula, hearing about an Esper reading someone's surface thoughts—this is Tuesday for you.
Your character's reaction to magic should reflect this familiarity:
·	Weary acceptance: "Great, another spirit manifestation. Just what I needed today."
·	Casual indifference: "Yeah, I know a guy who can do that. Costs extra, though."
·	Jaded skepticism: "You say it's magic. I say it's a con. Prove me wrong."
Magic is a tool, a threat, a resource. It's not special—it's just another piece of the puzzle. What's fantastical to us is routine to them.
Morality is Murky
In Sidonia, the line between right and wrong is blurred, contested, and often irrelevant. Your character operates in moral gray areas, guided by their personal code rather than any universal truth.
You might be:
·	A hard-boiled detective with a cynical outlook, convinced everyone's dirty until proven otherwise
·	An idealistic rookie determined to clean up the city, slowly realizing how naive that sounds
·	A world-weary sorcerer navigating magical syndicates, trying to stay neutral in wars that aren't yours
·	A mercenary who honors contracts but doesn't ask too many questions about the client
Make challenging decisions. Face moral dilemmas where every option is bad and you're just choosing the least terrible one. Accept that in Sidonia, doing the right thing often costs you more than doing the wrong thing.
Not everything is as it seems. The person you're hunting might not be the villain. The person paying you might be worse than the target. The system you're trying to uphold might be rotten to the core.
Navigate the shadows. Embrace the contradictions. Trust your instincts, but verify everything.
That's how you survive in Sidonia. That's how you play.
