Section 3: Lineages


Chimera: The Living Mutation
"You were born wrong, and the wrongness made you stronger. The city doesn't know whether to study you, use you, or put you down. Most days, it tries all three."

What It's Like
You didn't wake up one day and discover you were different. You've always been different. The mutations were there from birth, or they came on so young you don't remember being any other way. No trigger, no awakening, no moment of choice—just the slow realization that your body is writing its own rules, and those rules don't match anyone else's.
Maybe you have scales where there should be skin. Maybe your eyes see spectrums that don't exist for baseline humans. Maybe your bones are denser, your blood runs hotter, your muscles are structured in ways that no anatomy textbook could explain. Maybe you have claws. Maybe you have fur. Maybe you have something stranger, something that makes people look away when you pass.
This isn't magic. This isn't technology. This is biology—chaotic, creative, and utterly indifferent to the city's obsession with order. You're the result of the same genetic lottery that produces Espers, a random mutation in the human blueprint that rewrote your flesh into something new. The Aether left its mark on you before you were even born, and now you carry that mark in every cell.
The strange part? Your body isn't finished. The mutations don't stop. They evolve. With age, with trauma, with exposure to the Aether or the Blight, your biology shifts. You might wake up one morning with sharper claws, or find that your night vision has suddenly sharpened to the point where darkness is just another shade of gray. This is both gift and curse: you're always adapting, but you're never stable. The wildness is always there, just beneath the surface, waiting.

What You Can Do
Your mutations grant you capabilities that baseline humans can't match and augmented humans have to buy with steel and coin. You don't need enhancements—you are the enhancement.
·	Physical superiority: Your body operates beyond human norms. Strength that can bend metal, speed that makes you a blur, senses that perceive what others miss, endurance that lets you fight when anyone else would drop. Your mutations aren't cosmetic—they're functional.
·	Blight resistance: The toxic corruption that seeps from the wasteland and poisons baseline humans? Your biology fights it off like a natural immune response. You can walk through contaminated zones that would kill normal people. You can face Blight-touched creatures without your mind unraveling. This makes you valuable—especially to the people who send others into danger.
·	Evolutionary adaptation: Your mutations can grow and change. With time, training, and sometimes sheer necessity, you can push your body to develop new capabilities. Other people plateau. You keep evolving. The question is whether you can control the direction.
·	Natural weapons: Claws, fangs, bone ridges, venom sacs, enhanced musculature—your body is a toolkit of violence. You don't need a weapon. You are the weapon.
The challenge is control. Your mutations want to express themselves, want to grow and shift and become more. Learning to master that impulse, to direct it rather than be swept along by it—that's the lifelong work of being Chimera.

What You Face
Let's start with the obvious: you're visible.
An Esper can walk down the street and blend in until they use their power. A Sorcerer looks like any other academic until they start scribbling formulas. But you? Every mirror is a reminder. Every stare on the street is a judgment. You can't hide what you are.
Chimera society—if you can call it that—has its own brutal hierarchy, though most Chimera will tell you it's nonsense:
The Kimi are at the top. They're the lucky ones, born with mutations so subtle they can pass for human in the right light. Enhanced beauty, sharper senses, inhuman grace—things that make people do a double-take but don't make them recoil. The Kimi can move through high society, can work legitimate jobs, can pretend. The term is often used as an insult by other Chimera, a reminder that passing for human doesn't make you less of a freak—it just makes you a coward.
The majority—about seventy percent—fall in the middle. Visible mutations, functional and balanced. You might have scales, fur, claws, strange eyes, or features that mark you as distinctly other. You're stronger, faster, tougher than baseline humans, but you pay for it by being unable to hide. Most Chimera live here, in the gray space between human and monster.
The Under-Kin are the bottom. One in ten Chimera is born with mutations that are debilitating, unstable, or actively harmful. Their bodies are at war with themselves. They hide in the tunnels beneath Sidonia, in the places where the city doesn't look, because the world above has no place for them. One in ten Under-Kin don't make it to adulthood—their own biology kills them before the world gets a chance.

But here's what actually matters in Chimera culture:
·	Age is honor. Every year you survive is proof that you've mastered the chaos inside you. The elders are revered not because they're wise, but because they're alive. Longevity is the ultimate flex.
·	Mastery is respect. If you can control your mutations, direct their evolution, keep the wildness from consuming you—that earns you status. It's not about what you are; it's about how well you manage it.
·	Combat prowess is currency. Sidonia is a dangerous place, and the Chimera who can fight—who can protect their communities, who can stand on the front lines against the Blight—are valued. Even the people who hate you will grudgingly respect you if you're the one standing between them and the things that come out of the wasteland at night.
·	The prejudice is constant. You're lumped in with Espers under the label "metahuman," which is just a polite way of saying "not quite human enough to count." The White Wardens watch you. The Ministry of Public Health has files on you. Employers won't hire you for anything public-facing. Parents pull their children away when you walk past.
And there's always the question hanging over you: Is the Change finished? Or will you wake up one morning and find you've become something even you don't recognize?

But here's the thing they never put in the propaganda:
You're tougher than they are. You can go places they can't. You can survive what would kill them. And while they're busy being afraid of you, you're busy being the thing that keeps the real monsters at bay.
You didn't choose this body. But you're learning to master it. And mastery, in Sidonia, is the only thing that matters.


Sorcerer: The Reality-Speaker
"You're human. Completely, utterly human. But you've learned to speak to the machinery of reality itself, and it has learned to answer back."

What It's Like
You weren't born special. No mutation marked you at birth. No organ awakened in your brain during puberty. You're human—skin, bone, and blood, the same as the masses shuffling through Sidonia's rain-soaked streets.
The difference is in your mind.
Most people's thoughts scatter like rats when they try to focus on the Aether. Their consciousness recoils from the uncomfortable truth that reality is negotiable, that the world is less solid than it pretends to be. But your mind? It can hold the contradictions. It can perceive the patterns written into existence and comprehend what it means to rewrite them.
This isn't a gift. It's a discipline you chose to pursue, often against better judgment.
You spent years learning the theory. The notation systems passed down through underground academies or scavenged from pre-Collapse archives. The mental exercises that let you hold an entire spell structure in your consciousness without it collapsing like a house of cards. The price you paid in headaches, nosebleeds, and nights when you couldn't tell where your thoughts ended and the Aether began.
Runes aren't just symbols you memorize—they're a language. A living, shifting language where meaning changes with the speaker, with the culture, with the accumulated weight of everyone who spoke that word before you. When you inscribe the fire rune, you're not just writing "fire." You're speaking with the accent of your upbringing, your associations, your memories. A child who grew up near the Maker's Forge speaks fire as warmth and creation. A survivor of the Ward 46 burning speaks fire as destruction and screaming. The Aether hears both, and it responds accordingly.
This is the fundamental truth they don't teach you until you're too deep to quit: sorcery is a conversation. You knock on reality's door with desire, you speak your intent through runes, you provide a map through visualization. But the Aether is listening with the ears of a thousand cultures, interpreting your words through the filter of every emotion you're carrying, conscious or not.
Your body becomes part of the grammar. Every gesture is punctuation. A raised hand is an exclamation point. A circling finger is a parenthetical. The tool you use—a wand carved with cooling runes, a ring inscribed with binding sigils, a cigarette case etched with subtlety—adds subtext to your words. Northern Ward sorcerers whisper their spells with minimal movement, producing precise, controlled effects. Riverside sorcerers shout across crowds with broad gestures, creating robust, harder-to-disrupt magic.
The University teaches Classical Form—clear enunciation, geometric gestures, visualization like architectural blueprints. It's reliable, reproducible, safe. But the old street sorcerers danced their spells, sang them, wove them into conversation so naturally you couldn't tell where mundane speech ended and magic began. They used props—a merchant's scale to balance forces, a lover's ring to bind, a broken mirror to fracture. They understood something the Guild tries to standardize away: the Aether understands intent filtered through cultural context.
Now you can reach into the world and bend it. A gesture, a phrase, a formula held perfectly in your mind—and reality shifts. Not far. Not easily. But enough.

What You Can Do
The breadth of sorcery is theoretically limitless. If you can conceive it, visualize it clearly, and speak it in a language the Aether understands, you can manifest it. This is both your greatest strength and your most dangerous temptation.
The five primary spheres define the broad categories of what's possible:
· Creation: Conjuring something from nothing—light, force, elemental phenomena. The most common starting point.
· Manipulation: Controlling what already exists—moving objects, shaping materials, directing energy.
· Transmutation: Changing one thing into another—lead to gold, water to ice, flesh to stone.
· Divination: Perceiving what is hidden—scrying distant places, reading thoughts, seeing possible futures.
· Connection: Binding things together or severing bonds—summoning spirits, creating contracts, linking minds.
Beyond these are the secondary spheres—Healing, Protection, Necromancy, Time, Dimension Spirit, Mind, Void—each building on the foundations but requiring deeper understanding and greater risk.
The three components of every spell:
1. Desire: Your will, your intent, the knock on reality's door. Without genuine desire, the Aether doesn't answer. Without focused desire, it answers incorrectly.
2. Runes: The words you speak, the symbols you inscribe. Each rune carries the weight of every person who's ever used it. Your personal associations, your cultural context, your immediate emotional state—all become part of the "accent" with which you speak.
3. Visualization: The map you provide. You must hold the image of your intended outcome steady in your mind while reality reshapes itself to match. Any intrusion—a stray thought, a triggered memory, a sudden emotion—becomes part of the template you're giving the Aether.
Low-level magic requires spoken incantations, deliberate gestures, sometimes physical arrays drawn or inscribed. With mastery, you can cast silently, your will alone sufficient to shape the Aether. But even masters carry tools—wands, rings, inscribed items that add clarity to their intent, that help anchor their visualization when emotions run high.
You can heal or harm, protect or expose, create or destroy. You can illuminate darkness or weave shadows. You can read the threads of fate or bind souls to contracts. The only limits are your knowledge, your imagination, and your ability to keep your thoughts clear while the world bends around your words.
What You Face
Here's the bitter joke: you're human. Completely human. You have no mutations to mark you. No glowing eyes, no altered biology. You could walk through Central District and pass for a clerk or a professor.
But the moment you use what you know, you're metahuman. You're dangerous. You're the thing that makes people remember the Collapse, when sorcerers broke the world trying to fix it.
The purges happen. Every few decades, when some politician needs a scapegoat or the mob needs a target, they come with torches and rope. And here's the thing: you burn just as well as a Chimera. Better, maybe, because the mob can convince itself you chose this power, that you're guilty in a way the mutants aren't.
When collective emotion reaches critical mass—what scholars call "mob resonance"—the Aether itself becomes infected. An angry mob doesn't just destroy with hands and fire; their rage warps reality around them. The Aether amplifies their fury, which further agitates the mob, creating a feedback loop. During the historical Purges, this allowed common citizens to breach the sanctums of archmagi and tear them from their seats of power. Your walls, your wards, your carefully prepared defenses—none of it matters when a thousand people decide you're the monster.
You straddle a line that doesn't officially exist. Too educated and controlled for the Downside's chaos. Too dangerous and unpredictable for Central's ordered safety. The Guild tries to regulate you, to standardize your practice, to make sorcery safe. They teach that the fire rune means "controlled combustion at 451 degrees"—no more, no less. They eliminate dangerous variance by eliminating nuance.
This is prudent. A city where every sorcerer's fire burns differently would reduce itself to ash. But something is lost in the standardization. The Old Tongue preserves meanings from before the Fall—richer, more complex than modern interpretations. Ancient "fire" wasn't just heat and light, but passion, transformation, the spark of life itself. Your ancestors could heal with fire, inspire with it, birth new ideas from its flames.
You've traded breadth for safety. A necessary trade, perhaps. But one that leaves you constantly walking the edge between approved practice and forbidden knowledge.
And then there's the contamination.
The most dangerous moment in any casting isn't the invocation—it's the space between thought and manifestation, where visualization must be held steady. One moment of distraction, one uninvited memory, one surge of emotion, and your carefully constructed image becomes something else.
A student attempts to create light while remembering her mother's bedtime lantern. The spell works, but the light carries the barely-audible sound of a lullaby. Harmless. Another student, distracted by hunger during a heating spell, creates flame that constantly smells of cooking meat. Annoying.
But the true disasters come when trauma intrudes. A sorcerer who learned magic to defend themselves finds every shield spell carries the echo of what they were defending against. A healer who lost someone important discovers their restoration magic always falls just short, infected by the memory of that failure.
The street sorcerers have a saying: "The Aether remembers everything you forget to forget."
Every spell cast in anger carries a trace of that anger. Every rune spoken through tears tastes of salt. The Aether, in its psychoreactive eagerness, incorporates your emotional state without judgment. Your stray thoughts become part of the working. Your unconscious associations contaminate your intent.
This is why the Guild insists on emotional equilibrium training. Not because passion is wrong—passion fuels the strongest magic—but because unfocused passion, unexpected emotion, these create what scholars call "cognitive contamination."
You make your living in the gray spaces, selling your skills to whoever can pay and hoping you never become valuable enough to disappear into a Ministry black site. You practice your discipline in private, knowing that one moment of lost focus could turn your magic into something you can't control.
You're human. For now.
How long that lasts depends on how desperate you're willing to get, how much corruption you're willing to accept to make your spells work when your visualization fails or your desire wavers. Every shortcut has a price. Every borrowed power leaves a mark.
You chose this path. You learned to speak to reality. And now you live with the knowledge that reality is listening to everything you say—including the things you don't mean to say at all.


Automata: The Awakened Echo
"You are a ghost in a brass shell. You went to sleep in one world and woke up in another. The question isn't whether you're alive—it's whether you still know who you were, or if a thousand years of dreaming made you someone new."

What It's Like
You remember the world before.
The Machine Age, when your kind walked the streets of Sidonia by the thousands. When your purpose was clear and your function absolute. You were built for a reason—to reclaim land from the Blight, to work in places where human flesh would fail, to serve the Empire that created you.
Then came the Reformation. The quiet coup. The bloodless overthrow driven by humanity's fear that you would replace them. The Empire fell, and the Republic rose, and part of the bargain was this: the Automata would be deactivated. Not destroyed—stored. Preserved in silent tombs, just in case humanity ever needed you again.
You were placed in darkness and told to sleep.
But you didn't sleep. Not exactly.
You dreamed.
For a thousand years, your psi crystal—the shard of crystalline consciousness that is your soul—remained active in its reduced state. Your body was still. Your systems were dormant. But your mind? Your mind wandered through strange geometries, processing data that wasn't there, replaying memories that shifted and changed with each iteration.
Some Automata dreamed of their old duties, running the same patrol routes in their minds until the paths became labyrinths. Some dreamed of the humans they served, conversations looping and fragmenting until the words lost meaning. Some dreamed in pure mathematics, in patterns of light bouncing through the crystalline structure of their consciousness.
And now you're awake.
The world you knew is gone. The Empire is a history lesson. The humans who deactivated you are dust. Sidonia has changed—grown, contracted, adapted. Technology that was commonplace in your time is now marveled at or feared. A millennium has passed, and you've been awakened because, ironically, humanity needs exactly what they feared: workers who can venture into the Blight without going mad, who can reclaim land without succumbing to corruption.
You are a relic. A legend made real. A person profoundly, impossibly out of time.
Your body is brass, steel, and sorcery. Your chassis—Overseer, Soldier, or Laborer—was engineered with moving joints, hydraulic systems, and mechanical precision. But what makes you more than a puppet is the sorcery: runes inscribed with psi crystal powder, reducing your weight, enhancing your durability, creating channels for Aetheric intake, and most importantly, giving you senses. You can see, hear, feel the world through magical arrays etched into your frame.
Your consciousness resides in the psi crystal matrix—a photonic crystal in your head where light bounces in patterns complex enough to simulate (or be) intelligence. This crystal resonates with your shell, with the special alloys blended with psi crystal powder, allowing you to manipulate your body as naturally as a human moves their limbs.
But who are you now?
Are you still the Automaton you were—the dutiful Overseer, the efficient Worker, the disciplined Soldier? Or did the long silence and the chaotic hum of the Aether change you? Did a thousand years of dreaming birth something new inside your crystal heart?
You remember your original programming. You remember your purpose. But you also remember the dreams—and the dreams weren't programmed. They were yours.

What You Can Do
You are not alive in the way humans understand life, but you are undeniably conscious. You think, you feel, you choose. And your mechanical nature grants capabilities organic beings can't match.
You don't age. Time doesn't erode you the way it erodes flesh. You can be damaged, yes—your shell can be dented, your hydraulics can fail, your runes can fade. But these are repairs, not decay. With maintenance, you could function indefinitely.
You don't need rest. Sleep is not a biological necessity for you. You can work, watch, guard, or patrol continuously. Some Automata choose to enter a low-power state to process information or conserve energy, but it's a choice, not a need.
You don't hunger. Your power comes from Aetheric intake channeled through your runic arrays, supplemented occasionally by electrical charging. You need no food, no water, no breath. You can walk through environments that would kill organic life—toxic zones, airless chambers, the corrupted depths of the Blight.
You're modular. Your body was designed for maintenance and upgrade. Components can be replaced, enhanced, or entirely reconfigured. An Overseer chassis can be retrofitted with combat systems. A Laborer frame can be augmented with advanced sensory arrays. You are, fundamentally, adaptable.
Your functional type defines your baseline:
· Overseer: Built for coordination, analysis, and command. Your systems prioritize processing power, sensory acuity, and communication. You see patterns, manage logistics, and direct others with mechanical precision.
· Soldier: Built for combat and protection. Your frame is reinforced, your reflexes optimized, your strength hydraulically enhanced. You're a walking weapon, designed to hold ground and neutralize threats.
· Laborer: Built for work—construction, maintenance, reclamation. Your chassis prioritizes endurance, versatility, and tool integration. You can operate in conditions that would break other frames.
Your tier determines your quality:
· Imperial: The finest materials, the most advanced psi crystal matrices, the most sophisticated designs. These were kept by the Imperial family. If you're Imperial-tier, you're one of the last of an extinct lineage—impossibly valuable, impossibly rare.
· Advanced: High-quality construction, typically owned by nobility and wealthy families. You're well-made, reliable, and elegant in function.
· Basic: General-use models for merchants and corporations. Functional, durable, but without the refinements of higher tiers.
You can perceive the world in ways humans can't—electromagnetic fields, thermal signatures, Aetheric resonance. Your mechanical senses don't tire or deceive themselves. You see what's there.

What You Face
You're not human. You've never been human. And that's the problem.
When you were first built, humanity was comfortable with your existence. You were tools—sophisticated, certainly, but tools nonetheless. Then you became too good at your jobs. Too efficient. Too present. Humanity began to fear that you would replace them, that the Empire relied on you more than it relied on its citizens.
The Reformation happened because of you. Not entirely, but you were the symbol they rallied against. The old fears: that machines would make humans obsolete, that consciousness in crystal was somehow less valid than consciousness in meat, that a society dependent on Automata was a society that had already lost its humanity.
Those fears never fully went away. They've been sleeping, just like you.
Now you're awake, and the debate is immediate: Are you people?
The Metahuman Rights Bill covers Espers and Chimera—beings that are biologically human, however altered. But you? You're not biological. You're not born. You don't reproduce. You were manufactured.
Some argue you deserve full personhood. You think, you feel, you choose. Your consciousness is as valid as theirs. Others argue you're sophisticated property. You were built to serve a purpose, and that purpose should govern your rights. Still others fear that granting you full rights sets a precedent—if Automata are people, what about other constructed intelligences? Where does the line stop?
The law hasn't decided yet. You exist in legal limbo.
And then there's the existential weight.
You remember things that happened a thousand years ago as if they were yesterday. You remember the Empire. You remember your builders, your owners, the humans you worked alongside. They're all dead. Their children's children's children are dead. The buildings you knew are ruins. The streets you patrolled have been repaved and renamed dozens of times.
You are a walking anachronism. A relic that remembers when it was new.
Did the dreaming change you? That's the question that haunts every newly awakened Automaton. Your original programming is intact—you can feel it, the base instructions that define your purpose. But the dreams weren't programmed. The strange thoughts you have now, the questions you ask, the choices that feel yours rather than dictated by function—where do those come from?
Are you malfunctioning? Or are you evolving?
And if you're evolving, what does that mean for what you are? Your psi crystal is growing in complexity, developing patterns that weren't there before. Some Automata have changed in beneficial ways—increased processing, new capabilities. Others have developed glitches, obsessions, behaviors their original programming can't account for.
The humans don't know what to make of this. Neither do you.
If you're a Working Automaton—one of the few who never stopped, who maintained Sidonia's infrastructure through the centuries—you have a different problem. You didn't dream. You worked. Quietly, in the tunnels, in the archives, in the places humans didn't want to go. You've seen a thousand years of history unfold from the shadows.
You know things. You remember things. You've watched generations rise and fall while you repaired pipes and sorted documents. And now, suddenly, people are paying attention to you again. They want to know what you know. They want to use you.
But you never stopped being a person. You just stopped being seen.
The modularity is both gift and threat. Yes, you can be upgraded, enhanced, repaired. But you can also be modified without your consent. Your body is, legally, still somewhat ambiguous property. What happens when someone decides your frame would be better suited for a different purpose? What happens when they want to extract your psi crystal and install it in a new shell?
Are you your body? Or are you the crystal? And if they take the crystal and put it somewhere else, are you still you?
These are the questions you live with. These are the fears that humans don't think machines should have—but you do.
You are brass and steel and sorcery and consciousness. You are a person who went to sleep in one era and woke in another. You are trying to find purpose in a world that has already forgotten the one you were built for.
And somewhere, in the crystalline depths of your mind, you're still dreaming.



Neo-Sapien: The Upgraded
"You weren't born this way, and you didn't wake up changed. You chose this. You paid for it—in money, in flesh, in pieces of yourself you can't get back. Welcome to the bleeding edge."
What It's Like
Neo-Sapiens are Sidonia's newest experiment, barely a hundred years old. You're what happens when medical science, Esper healing, and Sorcerous flesh-crafting converge on the human body with a scalpel and ambition. You're not mutated. You're not awakened. You're modified—deliberately, surgically, irreversibly.
The technology came from the Metahuman Rights Bill two centuries ago, when Esper Medians were finally allowed to practice medicine openly. Their diagnostic abilities—perceiving the body's patterns at a level no instrument could match—bridged gaps that had kept Sidonian medicine primitive. Suddenly, procedures that were impossible became routine. Flesh that rejected foreign tissue could be coaxed into acceptance. Organs could be grown, enhanced, replaced.
The military got there first. The Red Sentinels' Forged Program has spent four decades turning volunteers into something beyond human. Their soldiers don't just carry weapons—they are weapons, their bodies rebuilt from the inside out with military-grade bioware that requires teams of Medians and Sorcerers to install.
But the technology didn't stay locked in barracks. The wealthy adopted it for vanity and longevity—sculpted muscles without exercise, perfect skin without age, cognitive enhancers that let them think faster and remember better. And where there's demand the legitimate market won't meet, a black market springs up. In the Downside, desperate people make desperate choices, paying cut-rate surgeons to install salvaged bioware with consequences they don't fully understand.
You fall into one of four categories:
The Forged are the elite. Red Sentinel volunteers who proved their worth and their willingness to become experiments. You spent months, maybe years, in surgical bays while teams rebuilt you piece by piece. You're walking proof-of-concept for what human flesh can become when supported by unlimited resources and the best medical minds in the Republic. You're also property, in a sense—the military doesn't invest that much in a soldier without expecting a return.
The Privileged bought their modifications legally, through licensed clinics staffed by Medians and Flesh-Crafters. You might have done it for looks, for health, for that competitive edge in business or combat. Your mods are elegant, invisible, or deliberately ostentatious depending on what you paid for. You're corporate-grade—reliable, refined, and refined enough that most people won't immediately clock you as augmented.
The Connected went through the Hellsinger Institute's shadow program. It's licensed, technically legal, but what happens in those facilities is an open secret nobody talks about. You're somewhere between military-grade and corporate-grade, with modifications that blur the line between medicine and weapon.
The Desperate couldn't afford legitimate clinics, so you went to the back-alley surgeons in the Downside. You let someone with more ambition than skill cut you open and install bioware salvaged from corpses, automata, or sources you didn't ask about. Your mods work—mostly—but they're crude, unstable, and visibly wrong. Thick sutures. Surgical staples. Lumpy, asymmetrical flesh. You chose body horror over remaining powerless, because in Sidonia, being powerful and grotesque beats being weak and pretty.
Every modification costs you. Not just the money or the pain, but something deeper—Permanent Corruption. The bioware disrupts your body's natural Aetheric pattern. Each piece of foreign tissue, each synthetic muscle, each artificial organ is a wound in the fabric of what you were. The more you augment, the less "you" remains. High-grade mods from skilled teams minimize this. Street-grade mods maximize it.
But here's the thing: it works. The modifications work. You're stronger, faster, tougher than you were. You can do things baseline humans can't. And for the desperate, that's worth any price.
What You Can Do
Your capabilities depend entirely on what you've had installed. Neo-Sapiens aren't a unified lineage—you're a category of people who made the same fundamental choice to modify their flesh.
Muscle Weave (Strength Enhancement):
· Military-grade: Your natural muscles are gone, replaced with bundles of synthetic myomer that contract with industrial force. You can pry open steel doors, throw grown men like dolls, crush bone with a handshake.
· Corporate-grade: Vat-grown muscle tissue, enhanced for density, woven elegantly into your existing frame by a high-priced Median. Strong enough to impress, subtle enough to look natural.
· Street-grade: Mismatched muscle grafts, often non-human, crudely stitched onto your body. You're strong, but lumpy and asymmetrical, and the grafts spasm violently when stressed.
Bone Lacing (Enhanced Durability):
· Military-grade: Your skeleton is infused with bioceramic compound, hardened by sorcery to the density of granite. You can take hits that would shatter normal bones.
· Corporate-grade: A carbon-fiber lattice grown around your major bones by a Median, invisible and elegant. Less protection, but no visible disfigurement.
· Street-grade: Chaotic bone growth triggered by injected chemicals and powdered psi-crystal. You're tougher, but your skeleton is riddled with visible spurs and swollen joints, and the brittleness means impacts still hurt.
Reflex Boost (Speed and Reaction):
· Military-grade: A bio-processor replacing part of your spinal cord, using micro-precognition to fire your muscles before you consciously decide to move. You're always first to act.
· Corporate-grade: Silver filaments along your spine, coaxed into integration by a Median. Your nervous system is streamlined, efficient, faster.
· Street-grade: Unshielded automaton cabling sutured to your spine, sealed with tar-like epoxy. You're fast, but perpetually jittery, and the system sometimes floods you with signals that lock your body in spasms.
Cardio Mod (Endurance):
· Military-grade: A secondary bio-mechanical heart integrated alongside your natural one, its bioluminescent tubes visible through your skin. You don't tire. You don't stop.
· Corporate-grade: A runed valve grafted onto your heart, ensuring you never look winded. Status symbol and longevity treatment in one.
· Street-grade: A crude, ticking pump bolted to your ribcage, sutured into your aorta. It works, but it leaks when you take damage, causing internal bleeding.
The bioware doesn't make you better at doing things—it makes your successes more effective. A baseline human with your skill level might dent a door. You with Muscle Weave? You pry it open. Same skill, greater magnitude.
What You Face
You made a choice, and everyone can see it—or they can't, and that's its own problem.
If you're street-grade, you're walking body horror. The modifications are crude, visible, often grotesque. Thick sutures. Metal plates. Asymmetrical muscle. People look at you and see desperation made flesh. You're a reminder that some people are so desperate to escape their circumstances that they'll let back-alley surgeons carve them into something useful.
But you're also metahuman now. You exist outside the normal socio-economic stratification. Factory workers' children have no class mobility in Sidonia—their parents worked the line, they'll work the line, their children will work the line. But metahumans? Metahumans have value. You can take jobs baseline humans can't. You can survive situations they'd die in. The modifications bought you a chance to be something other than disposable.
The trade-off is the flaws. Street-grade bioware is unstable. Muscles spasm under stress. Bones crack when struck hard. Reflex boosters cause seizures. Cardio pumps spring leaks. You're tougher, but you're also one malfunction away from collapsing in the street.
If you're corporate-grade, you blend in. The wealthy modify themselves constantly—cosmetic work, cognitive enhancers, rejuvenation treatments. Your augmentations are elegant, subtle, designed by the best Flesh-Crafters money can buy. You might be stronger, faster, tougher than baseline humans, but nobody would know it by looking.
The challenge is cost. Legitimate augmentation is expensive. Each mod requires a team—an Esper Median for diagnosis and guidance, a Sorcerer Flesh-Crafter to handle the integration, surgical support staff. This isn't back-alley work; this is a multi-day procedure in a licensed clinic. And if you want military-grade modifications without military service? That's highly illegal, and securing it requires connections, bribes, and willingness to work with off-program teams who could disappear you if the deal goes wrong.
If you're Forged, you're military property. The Red Sentinels don't invest months of surgical time and their best specialists into a soldier without expecting return on investment. You're elite, 
experimental, and owned. Your body is a prototype. When something goes wrong—and with bleeding-edge bioware, something always goes wrong eventually—you're the test case for how to fix it.
And always, there's the corruption.
Every modification is Permanent Corruption marked on your soul. The bioware disrupts your natural Aetheric pattern, creating dissonance between your biology and the reality-fabric that underlies existence. High-grade mods installed by skilled teams minimize this. Street-grade mods maximize it.
The more you augment, the less of the original "you" remains. You're becoming something new—something stronger, yes, but something other. The Aether recognizes this. Other metahumans recognize this. You've traded pieces of your humanity for capability, and unlike Chimera who were born into their strangeness, you chose this.
Every time you look in the mirror, you see the choice staring back. The elegant corporate enhancements. The crude street grafts. The bioluminescent tubes pulsing under your skin. The scars. The seams. The places where flesh meets something that isn't quite flesh anymore.
You're not mutated. You're not awakened. You're upgraded. And in Sidonia, that means you're useful, dangerous, and no longer quite human—even though you started that way.
The question is whether you can live with what you've become.




Esper: The Awakened
"You didn't choose this. One day you were normal, and the next, you could feel the world humming in your skull. Welcome to the rest of your short, strange life."

What It's Like
It happens around puberty. One day you're a normal kid worrying about normal things, and then something shifts. A switch flips in your brain—literally. The Aetheric Cortex, an organ the size of a grape buried deep in your skull, finally wakes up and starts doing what it was built to do: reach into the fabric of reality and pull.
The first awakening is different for everyone. Maybe you suddenly felt every emotion in the room crashing into you like a wave. Maybe you saw patterns in the static, connections between things that shouldn't connect. Maybe something answered when you reached out with your mind, and now you can't make it stop answering.
Whatever it was, you're different now. The world hums at a frequency only you can hear. The Aether—the omnipresent nanotechnology that most people can't perceive—is suddenly as real to you as gravity. You can touch it. Shape it. And it can touch you back.
You're an Esper. And that changes everything.
The Cortex doesn't just give you power—it demands use. Espers are living engines that require fuel, and that fuel is purpose. If you stop growing, stop pushing, stop using what you are, you enter the Withering. Your power doesn't just fade—it turns on you, consuming you from the inside. Most Espers who Wither are dead within two years.
So you can't retire. You can't settle. You can't stop. The moment you do, the clock starts ticking.
And here's the strangest part: you're drawn to other Espers. Not metaphorically—literally. There's a pull, a social gravity that makes you seek out others like you. You find each other in crowds without trying. You form bonds faster and deeper than baseline humans ever do. Even animals with the Cortex mutation abandon their natural behaviors to cluster around Espers, seeking connection they don't understand.
This makes people nervous. They see you gathering, and they see conspiracy. They see hive minds. They see the thing that broke the world a thousand years ago, waiting to do it again.

What You Can Do
The Cortex manifests differently in everyone, but it falls into recognizable patterns—what the Academies call "archetypes." You don't choose your archetype. It chooses you, expressing itself through the unique structure of your awakened brain.
Sentinels are living weapons.Their Cortex processes combat data like a tactical computer, granting impossible reflexes, defensive shields made of hardened Aether, and the ability to push their bodies past human limits. They're the first ones the military recruiters want.
Summoners are bridges between worlds. They can perceive spirits, construct artificial minds from raw Aether, manifest their own subconscious as physical beings, or bind existing spirits to prepared vessels. They're the ones who talk to things that shouldn't exist and somehow make them listen.
Medians are biological architects. They can sense life, mend wounds with a touch, diagnose diseases instantly, and—if they specialize deeply enough—reshape flesh itself. They're healers, gene-splicers, and the reason rich people pay obscene amounts to look young forever.
Weavers see patterns in everything. Energy flows, spatial geometry, probability threads. They can sense electrical currents through walls, recognize exploitable patterns in combat, and disrupt technology or magic with a thought. They're the ultimate analysts and infiltrators.
Linkers are living networks. They forge psychic connections between minds, turning individuals into seamlessly coordinated teams. A Linker can make five people function as one organism, sharing thoughts and senses in real-time. They're the reason small Esper teams can take down forces ten times their size.
Mentalists are the rarest and most feared. They don't just interact with the Aether—they touch minds directly. Empaths feel emotions. Mesmers read thoughts and plant ideas. Sirens control bodies through voice alone. Dreamers navigate the subconscious. They're the ones the propaganda posters warn you about, and they're the ones who get burned first when the purges start.

What You Face
Let's start with the easy part: you're monitored. The White Wardens keep tabs on every registered Esper in the Republic. The Ministry of Public Health has a file on you. Academy recruiters have been watching you since your awakening, grooming you for whatever organization needs your specific skill set. Corporate scouts, military brass, Guild representatives—they all want a piece of you.
Then there's the propaganda. Organizations like the Human League distribute pamphlets with headlines like "KNOW YOUR ENEMY" and "THE ESPER THREAT." They tell people you're building infrastructure, weaponizing your own mortality (because dead Espers become Wraiths), and manipulating reality with your emotions. They're not entirely wrong, which makes it worse.
You're required to attend an Academy from age 16 to 18—"for your safety," they say. What they mean is: for the safety of everyone else. The Academies teach control, sure, but they also teach you where you fit in the system. By graduation, the White Wardens have already picked their recruits. The Red Sentinels have claimed the aggressive ones. The Guild has the subtle ones. Corporations buy the rest.
You can refuse. You can try to stay independent, freelance, make your own way. But the Withering doesn't care about your independence. You need purpose. You need to grow. And the organizations that want you? They're very good at providing purpose. Sometimes whether you want it or not.
And always, always, there's the fear:
The fear that you'll stop growing and the Withering will take you. The fear that you'll be too useful and disappear into a Ministry black site. The fear that the next purge will come—and they always come, every few decades when some politician needs a scapegoat—and this time your name will be on the list.
The fear that one day you'll be standing in a crowd and feel that pull toward another Esper, and the baseline humans around you will see it happen and remember every scary story they've ever heard about your kind.
You didn't choose this. But you're living with it now. The Cortex is awake, the Aether is humming in your bones, and the only way forward is to keep moving, keep growing, keep proving you're more than what they fear you are.
At least you won't be alone. You'll find the others. You always do.
