# Sidonia: World Overview

**[Location: Sidonia, The Caldera] [Concept: Isolation] [Flavor_Text]**
Sidonia is a grand city-state with a diameter of 200 kilometers, set within a massive Caldera nearly 1000km across. Ringed by the highest peaks on the continent of Ansalon, it is completely isolated from the rest of the world of Aetherion.
* **The Fall:** A calamity 3000 years ago drained the city's water sources into subterranean tunnels, forcing humanity underground for a millennium.
* **The Dome:** An energy barrier maintains a viable environment inside, warding off the harsh external climate.

## District Geography & Climate
**[Location: Central District, Outer Districts] [Mechanic: Water Scarcity]**

* **Central District (32 Wards):** The most influential area. They control the water system and receive the most rainfall due to the dome's micro-climate.
* **Eastern District:** Second highest rainfall; relatively independent water supply.
* **Western/Southern Districts:** Parched (1-2 inches of rain/year); entirely dependent on Central shipping water.
* **The Blight:** Only 70% of the land is reclaimed. The remaining 30% is toxic to humans.
    * **[Corruption: Causes permanent corruption]** Toxicity manifests in mild physical symptoms but severe sanity degradation with prolonged exposure.

## Population & Wealth Distribution
**[Concept: Inequality] [Location: Central District] [Complexity: Easy to understand]**

Over half of the 5 million residents dwell in the affluent Central District.
* **Inner Wards:** Population cap of 100,000 per ward.
* **Outer Wards:** No population quotas; uniform in size but increasing in area further from the center.
* **Migration Policy:** To mitigate overpopulation, Central actively relocates "less desirable" inhabitants to outer wards while recruiting scholars and artisans (Brain Drain).

## Political Landscape
**[Faction: Central Government] [Faction: Reformist Party] [Concept: Political Instability]**

The status quo is dominated by Central, which exploits the unique identities of outer districts to prevent them from unifying.
* **The Reformist Party:** A new group gaining popularity in the outer districts, born from discontent with Central's exploitation.
* **Central's Strategy:** Uses infrastructure projects to extend influence and divert money back to the center.

### Political Philosophies
**[Concept: Political Ideologies] [Complexity: More advanced]**
Unlike traditional parties, Sidonia has philosophical fault lines:

1.  **The Custodians (Originalists):** Believe current woes result from deviating from the Republic's original architecture (1069 years ago).
2.  **Centralists:** Support increasing centralized government/Ministry power. Policy should be top-down.
3.  **Federalists:** Support decentralizing power to local ward bosses.
4.  **Expansionists:** Support returning Sidonia to a pre-fall state via reclamation.
    * **[Lineage: Automata] [Location: Ward 64]** Usage of Automata for reclamation is controversial; Ward 64 is currently the test case.

## Education & Discrimination
**[Faction: Ministry of Information] [Concept: Education System]**

* **Ages 6-12 (Formal):** Mandatory. Followed by apprenticeships (often menial for working class).
* **Ages 12-16 (Secondary):** Marks an individual as "Well-Educated."
* **Ages 16-20 (University):** Private, expensive, required for high-level professions.

### Social Stratification
**[Faction: Seconders] [Location: Eastern District]**
* **Seconders:** Descendants of immigrants who arrived just before The Fall (3000 years ago). Faces discrimination for their unique culture/clan dynamics.

**[Lineage: Chimera] [Concept: Discrimination]**
Commonly called 'Kimmies', Chimera face discrimination from humans and other Chimera.

* **Wild Chimera:** Spontaneous mutations (increased chance if parents are Chimera).
    * *Under-kin:* Those with non-beneficial mutations, often living underground.
* **Pure Chimera:** Breeds that produce consistent offspring.
    * *Oneeri:* A specific stable breed.
    * *Bone Tribe:* Exoskeleton structures. Males are armored/aggressive; Females have venomous/spurred bone deposits.

## Architecture
**[Location: Central District] [Location: Outer Districts] [Flavor_Text]**

* **Outer Districts:** Chaotic footprint, grown organically over 1500 years. Features barred windows and defensive walls against the Blight.
* **Central District:** Protected by the Aegis shield wall. Open, inviting layouts resembling a 1930s American metropolis.

### Building Materials
**[Mechanic: Forge-Crete] [Faction: Guild of Arcane Practitioners]**
* **Forge-Crete:** The primary building block. Ten times stronger than reinforced concrete, impervious to decay, and can change texture/color via transmutation sorcery.
